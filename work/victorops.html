					<h2>Summary</h2>
					<p class="lead">As an early stage startup, VictorOps depended on making an unforgettable first impression throughout every digital touchpoint, driving users into trial signups and product demos.</p>

			<h2>Redesigning the Enterprise Experience</h2>

					<p class="lead">Early on, our customers primarily consisted of our end-users. As VictorOps expanded into the enterprise market, we were now selling to C-suite executives at large corporations.</p>

					<p class="lead">We saw a pattern that these executives were less likely to follow through after signing up for free trials or our weekly public demo. Through auditing our personas, we discovered the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Management is busy</li>
						<li>They’re less technical than our traditional customer and not interested in a free trial of our software</li>
						<li>They’re motivated by improving the quality of their employees lives and saving the company money in the long run</li>
					</ul>
