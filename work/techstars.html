<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Since inventing the startup accelerator over a decade ago, Techstars now has hundreds of thousands of entrepreneurs in our network, and we have 30+ public facing websites and several internal products to meet their needs.</p>

<p>I lead the user experience and digital strategy for Techstars' web products. As we continue to grow as a company and diversify our revenue, Iâ€™ve worked to build a scalable design system and optimize our digital touchpoints.</p>

				<p>What started out as a single accelerator in Boulder, CO, Techstars has scaled to over 150 countries worldwide, and in the process we'd amassed 10 years of inconsistent styles, branding, and typography along the way.</p>

				<p>As a first step in providing a consistent user and brand experience, I conducted an audit of our digital properties to see what we were dealing with. When it was all said and done, I ended up with 30+ web products built over multiple tech stacks, with dozens of colors and fonts in the mix.</p>

						<div class="container-text">
				<p>I set out to create a simplified system with the following goals in mind:</p>
				<h3>Consistency</h3>
				<p>How do we provide a cohesive web experience? At the very least, how do we make sure users don't have to wonder if they're still on a Techstars-owned domain?</p>
				<h3>Extensibility</h3>
				<p>Techstars co-brands several of it's products with companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. In addition, we have thousands of alumni companies that have gone through our programs, how does Techstars become a vessel to let these brands shine without stealing the spotlight?</p>
				<p>Also, We have several community leaders, stakeholders, and outside agencies who work with Techstars. How do we empower them to build the best possible experiences on their own without being a bottleneck?</p>
				<h3>Scalability &amp; Speed</h3>
				<p>Lastly, the company is scaling at an incredibly rapid pace, how do we build a system to grow with it? And how do we build a solid foundation so we don't have to reinvent the wheel every time we kick off a new web project?</p>

	<p>The result was a super streamlined design system (built on the priciples of Atomic Design) that could easily extend itself to our many products.</p><p>Along with consolidating our elements, I extended this minamlist approach throughout the grid system and layout choices, reserving Techstars green specifically for actionable or important moments during the web experience.</p>
