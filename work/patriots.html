<h3>Summary</h3>
					<p>As the first sports team to have a website in 1995, as well as the first NFL team to reach a million followers on Twitter, the New England Patriots have led the sports world in digital experiences for the past 3 decades.</p>

					<p>I was fortunate to have worked with Patriots Digital Media to design experiences for <a href="https://patriots.com" target="_blank">Patriots.com</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Patriots" target="_blank">@Patriots</a>, the <a href="https://proshop.patriots.com/" target="_blank">Patriots Proshop</a>.</p>

					<p>In addition, I created graphics for digital and print displays throughout Patriots Place, photographed and edited images and audio from press conferences and locker room interviews, as well as designed marketing emails which were delivered to hundreds
						of thousands of inboxes on a weekly basis and received <a href="https://www.espn.com/boston/nfl/story/_/id/10900270/new-england-patriots-offer-jersey-guarantee-fans" target="_blank">national press coverage</a>.</p>
